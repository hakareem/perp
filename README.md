<h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 46px;">My Developer Portfolio Website! ⚡️</h1>
 I have used HTML & CSS & Javascript to build this project. I created a personal profile to serve as an introduction. Within the project, I shared my technical experiences, professional goals and strengths. 


# Learning Experience  
This was a fantastic learning opportunity for me as I was able to demonstrate evidence of my relevant skills and abilities. I definitely improved various skills, for example I had the opportunity to apply my creativity skills to innovate new designs and possibilities for the project. I designed it this particular way to serve as a single page application where you can click links and you'll be taken to other parts of the project.

<h1>What I Changed </h1>
• Added external Link buttons to the top of the site <br>
• Added Nav buttons to quickly get to your desired section <br>
• Added a new section for skills and changed section order (this messed with the original formatting quite a bit) <br>
• Built a functional Contact Form <br>

<h1>What I learned</h1> 
• CSS Animations <br>
• Deployed to Github Pages <br>
• Project structure <br> 
• Responsive Design <br>
• Media Queries

# Areas for improvement
My portfolio can certainly be developed and improved further. I will do this by:

• Simplifying user experience <br>
• Being selective with projects <br>
• Custom Web URL <br>
• Appealing Visual Design and Layout <br>
• Project Description <br>

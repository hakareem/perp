# Portfolio
 I have used HTML & CSS & Javascript to build this project. I created a personal profile to serve as an introduction. Within the project, I shared my technical experiences, professional goals and strengths. 


# Learning Experience 
This was a fantastic learning opportunity for me as I was able to demonstrate evidence of my relevant skills and abilities. I definitely improved various skills, for example I had to apply my creative thinking skills to innovate new designs and possibilities for my project.


# Areas for improvement
My portfolio can certainly be developed and improved further. I will do this by:

Simplifying user experience 
Being selective with projects
Custom Web URL 
Appealing Visual Design and Layout
Project Description

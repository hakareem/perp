        <h2>What I Do For Fun?</h2>
        <p>
        I like to play video games when I'm at home, especially puzzle games. I like how fast-paced video games are, and I enjoy a little healthy competition with myself and my friends for higher scores. I find that a little healthy competition helps me continue to learn and grow so I can be the best version of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy watching football. Supporting my favorite football team isn't a passive activity for me. Of course, I like to watch the big game when it comes on TV. But what I find even more enjoyable is getting involved in my team's community. Coming together with other people to support one goal is a great way to feel like a part of something bigger than yourself.

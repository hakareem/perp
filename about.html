One of the reasons I’m really passionate about working in Technology is that it’s an incredibly satisfying industry to work in,I will be able to assist people and create solutions to problems. I find this aspect of Technology to be very enjoyable, it’s highly rewarding and would allow me to forge great relationships with people.</p>
        <p> What I find most exciting about Technology, is that whether you’re Front-End or Back-End Engineer, a career in Tech will constantly expose you to new developments and concepts. The Tech industry is constantly changing and evolving with exciting new ideas and technology and I want to work in an industry that’s always breaking boundaries and improving our everyday lives.

        <h2>What I Do For Fun?</h2>
        <p>
        I like to play video games when I'm at home, especially puzzle games. I like how fast-paced video games are, and I enjoy a little healthy competition with myself and my friends for higher scores. I find that a little healthy competition helps me continue to learn and grow so I can be the best version of myself.
        </p>
        <p>
        I enjoy watching football. Supporting my favorite football team isn't a passive activity for me. Of course, I like to watch the big game when it comes on TV. But what I find even more enjoyable is getting involved in my team's community. Coming together with other people to support one goal is a great way to feel like a part of something bigger than yourself.
